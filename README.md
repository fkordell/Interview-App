# Interview-App

This is the final project for our CSE-341 class at BYU-Idaho. This application involves creating four different collections that will be stored in a MongoDB. Each collection has its own set of fields. The project can be tested using Swagger UI. Users must be authenticated/authorized before being able to POST, PUT, or delete data. Additionally, certain fields have their own data validation. The JSON-fetched data is also displayed on frontend web pages. Users can also utilize GraphQL to fetch data.
